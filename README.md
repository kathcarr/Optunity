How to use page:
On mainpage select state from drop down, then either select the filters you would like to use and click the button or just click the "display opportunities" button to see all of the opportunities for your selected state. In order to create a new search either clear filters, which won't clear the  page, or hit the back button to go back to the main page and reselect your state.
